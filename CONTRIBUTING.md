Welcome to the **E-Commerce Shopping Site** project! We’re excited to have you participate in Hacktoberfest 2024 and contribute to this project. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, we encourage you to contribute in any way you can.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository
Before making any changes, fork the repository to your GitHub account:

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the page.
3. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

cd e-commerce-shopping-site
```

### 3. Create a New Branch
Create a new branch to isolate your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the feature or bug fix you're working on. For example, if you're fixing a bug in the checkout process:

```bash
git checkout -b fix-checkout-bug
```

### 5. Test Your Changes
After making your changes, ensure that everything works properly by running the app locally:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 6. Commit and Push Changes
Once you’ve made and tested your changes, commit them with a descriptive message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Resolved checkout bug"
git push origin your-branch-name
